# Used_car_valuation

 ## Project Description: 
 This project, Used_car_valuation, was developed as part of the IBM course "Analyzing Data with Python." The primary goal is to create a predictive model capable of estimating the prices of used cars based on various vehicle features, such as manufacturing year, mileage, make, model, and other relevant variables.
 
The project follows a complete data science pipeline, from data acquisition and cleaning to modeling and performance evaluation. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we implement and compare different machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Polynomial regression, and Ridge regression, to identify the most accurate model.


## Project Steps:

### 1.	Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
Collection and inspection of raw data.
Handling missing values, categorizing variables, and normalizing data.

### 2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualization of variable distributions.
Analysis of correlations between variables and identification of outliers.

### 3.	Modeling:
Application of various machine learning models to predict car prices.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### 4.	Model Evaluation:
Comparing model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².
Selection of the best model based on the balance between accuracy and generalization.

### 5.	Implementation and Testing:
Applying the model to new data to predict the prices of unseen cars.

### 6.	Technologies Used:
•	Language: Python
•	Tools: Jupyter Notebook
